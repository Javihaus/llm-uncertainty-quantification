# TAP Uncertainty Quantification - Experimental Results

## Experiment Overview

This document presents the experimental validation of the TAP (Theory of Adjacent Possible) uncertainty quantification method for Large Language Models, as described in the paper "Information-Theoretic Uncertainty Quantification for Large Language Models: Grounding Adjacent Possible Theory in Next-Token Probabilities".

## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed Components:**
- TAP uncertainty quantification framework
- Baseline methods (softmax confidence, entropy-based)
- Model interfaces for multiple architectures (GPT-2, Qwen 2.5, Gemma 2, SmolLM2)
- Calibration metrics (ECE, Brier Score, AUROC)
- Dataset preprocessing (TruthfulQA, MMLU subsets, factual knowledge)
- Computational efficiency analysis

## Theoretical Validation

### TAP Method Implementation

The TAP uncertainty method is implemented as follows:

```
U_TAP(s) = (1/n) * Σ[i=1 to n] f(perplexity(s_i | s_{<i}))

where f(p) = 1 - exp(-β * p)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Perplexity-based adjacency**: Eliminates arbitrary distance thresholds
- **Information-theoretic grounding**: Direct connection to model's learned distributions  
- **Single forward pass**: O(|V|) complexity per token vs O(N*|V|) for ensemble methods
- **Calibrated uncertainty**: Intrinsically aligned with training data coverage

### Baseline Comparisons

1. **Softmax Confidence**: `1 - max(P(t|c))`
2. **Entropy Uncertainty**: `H(P(·|c)) / log|V|`
3. **Predictive Entropy**: `-log P(t_target|c)`

## Synthetic Data Validation

### Test Cases
- **High Confidence**: Peaked probability distributions (low uncertainty expected)
- **Low Confidence**: Flat probability distributions (high uncertainty expected)
- **Medium Confidence**: Moderate probability concentration

### Expected Results
Based on theoretical foundations:

1. **Monotonicity**: TAP uncertainty should increase as probability distributions become flatter
2. **Calibration**: High uncertainty should correlate with prediction errors
3. **Efficiency**: Computation time should be minimal (microsecond scale)
4. **Interpretability**: Adjacent possible size should reflect distribution breadth

## Model Evaluation Framework

### Models Evaluated
- **GPT-2**: Baseline transformer model (117M parameters)
- **Qwen 2.5 3B**: Modern efficient architecture
- **Gemma 2 2B**: Google's lightweight model
- **SmolLM2**: Specialized small model

### Evaluation Datasets
- **TruthfulQA**: Tests factual accuracy and hallucination detection
- **MMLU subsets**: Domain-specific knowledge evaluation
- **Factual Knowledge**: Simple factual questions

### Metrics
- **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**: Measures calibration quality
- **Brier Score**: Probabilistic accuracy measure  
- **AUROC**: Error prediction capability
- **Computation Time**: Efficiency comparison

## Expected Experimental Outcomes

Based on theoretical analysis, we hypothesize:

### H1: Calibration Performance
TAP uncertainty will show better calibration (lower ECE) compared to confidence-based methods due to its grounding in the model's learned probability distribution.

### H2: Computational Efficiency
TAP will demonstrate competitive efficiency with single forward pass methods while providing richer uncertainty information than simple confidence measures.

### H3: Error Prediction
TAP uncertainty will show strong correlation with prediction errors (high AUROC) across different model architectures and datasets.

### H4: Cross-Model Consistency
TAP uncertainty patterns will remain consistent across different model architectures, indicating robustness of the approach.
